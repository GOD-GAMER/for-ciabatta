# Security

Keep your stream and viewers safe while using BakeBot.

- Treat tokens as secrets; never commit `.env`
- Limit exposure: keep GUI private (localhost or behind reverse proxy)
- Use HTTPS for public endpoints (tunnels or proper TLS)
- Prefer long random secrets for EventSub
- Update regularly and review dependencies
